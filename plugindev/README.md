## Instructions for Open Image Pipeline plugin development.

This directory (plugindev) contains files to help in setting
up a plugin development environment. 

#### 1. Directory layout setup

There are already some files in place but you must change some things
before you can start programming your very own OIP plugin.
First of all, if you're using GIT for version control, you should 
probably create a `.gitignore` file with at least the following lines.

`bin`
`build-config`

This applies to other version control systems too, of course, but I
have no idea how they handle ignoring files. `build-config` is a file
that's generated by `config-build-env.sh` and it's only needed by
you because it contains paths specific to your computer. `bin` is
the directory where compiled binaries are put, so you probably don't
want those in your VCS.

By default the makefile compiles the plugin from files located in
a directory calles `src`. You need to create this one by yourself.

#### 2. Customizing the makefile

The only customization step that's needed for the makefile is to
change the name of the plugin. The name is stored in the NAME variable
in the makefile, so change that one to the name of your plugin.

#### 3. Compiling Open Image Pipeline

In order to compile plugins you need to compile the main OIP binary
too. Go into the root directory of the OIP source files and then run
`make main modules`. This command will compile the main OIP binary and
everything that's needed to compile plugins.

#### 4. Final setup steps

Now you're almost ready to start programming away. You just need to
run the shell script `config-build-env.sh`. After answering the questions
the script has asked you, you can create your source files in the `src`
directory and once you are ready to compile the plugin, just run `make`. By
running `make install` too, you can automatically copy the plugin
file to the Open Image Pipeline plugins directory.
