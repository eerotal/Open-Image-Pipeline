file.c: 
    rmdir_recursive():
      - Check if the directory exists before trying to delete it.

multiple:
    - Modify the dirty arguments flag of plugins to work with the new
      job based image processing system. Perhaps the program should generate
      a hash of all the plugin arguments that's then stored in the JOB instance
      that is being processed.

unknown:
    - Memory corruption when exiting after image processing. (Freeing non-allocated memory?)
        - Can't seem to reproduce anymore. Weird.
